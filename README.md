# todolist
This is a simple to-do list app that lets users create tasks and projects to keep track of their responsabilities. (You know what a to-do list is, right?) It was written from the ground-up by myself.

Users can:
1. Create tasks and mark them as complete
2. Add descriptions to tasks
3. Mark tasks as important
4. Create projects, containing tasks
5. Delete tasks and projects

In attition to all this, users' data is automatically saved on their local storage.
